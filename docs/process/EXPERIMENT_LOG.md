## Session 8 — v0.6.2 Operations sign-in fix (patch) — 2026-06-26

**Goal:** The human's v0.6.1 review reported a **new, blocking regression** — they
could no longer sign in to Meridian Operations at all (after a successful login the
dashboard flashed, then bounced back to the sign-in screen with the v0.6.1 "session
has ended" notice, looping forever and surviving a cookie clear; both Sam and Riley
affected) — and **explicitly re-scoped the session away from v0.7.0** to a patch
release `v0.6.2` fixing only that bug for them to test. So: do NOT start Money
movement; root-cause the login loop, fix it, prove it, document, tag.

**Branch-history surprise (resolved first):** the fresh session branch
(`claude/gracious-fermi-5cfomj`) was cut from `main` (**v0.6.0**) and did **not**
contain v0.6.1 — that work was a **single commit (`52347db`) on an UNMERGED branch**
(`origin/claude/dreamy-maxwell-njcxe7`) never merged to `main`. Since the bug being
fixed is literally the v0.6.1 recovery handler escalating a pre-existing 401 into a
loop, the fix has to sit on top of v0.6.1, so the branch was **fast-forwarded** to
include `52347db` — it now carries v0.6.0 + v0.6.1 + v0.6.2.

**Bug (B-06) — operator sign-in loop:** confirmed real, and not role/cookie-specific
(both staff users). Diagnosis by reproduction, narrowing to the same-origin request
shape:
- **Backend `app.inject` with an explicit ops `Origin`:** login sets `mer_ops_session`;
  `/api/auth/me` + `/api/ops/*` GETs 200. The Origin path is correct (matching the
  v0.6.1 curl checks).
- **Backend `app.inject` with NO `Origin` on the GET** (the same-origin browser shape):
  the authenticated GET resolved to the **customer** cookie and **401'd** —
  reproducing the loop's trigger. Adding `x-meridian-surface: operations` to that same
  request returns 200 — the fix, empirically.
- **Real Chromium, route-rewritten** to strip `Origin` on GET/HEAD only (keeping it on
  the login POST, exactly how a same-origin browser behaves): pre-fix it loops; post-
  fix the operator reaches the dashboard, the queue loads, and a reload restores the
  session.

**Root cause (B-06):** the backend picks the per-surface session cookie
(`mer_session` customer / `mer_ops_session` operations) from the request **`Origin`
header**, defaulting to the **customer** surface when `Origin` is absent/unrecognized
(`apps/backend/src/auth/cookies.ts` → `sessionAudienceForOrigin`). But **browsers omit
`Origin` on same-origin GET requests** — they send it on the login POST but not on
safe-method GETs. In a same-origin deployment the operator's authenticated `/api/ops/*`
GETs arrived with no `Origin`, were treated as customer, read the empty `mer_session`,
and returned **401**. v0.6.0 surfaced that exact 401 as the "Not authenticated"
dead-end (original B-04); the v0.6.1 recovery handler then escalated the same 401 into
an **unrecoverable login loop**. The standard cross-origin dev setup (`:5174` →
`:3000`) **always** sends `Origin`, which is precisely why local runs, the v0.6.1 curl
checks (ops Origin set), and the cross-origin Playwright suite all passed while the
human's same-origin environment failed — the blind spot.

**Fix (B-06):** each front-end app declares its surface via an explicit header
`AUTH.surfaceHeader` = `x-meridian-surface` that the backend trusts **ahead of**
`Origin` (Origin stays a fallback, so the Socket.IO handshake, cross-origin dev, and
existing Origin-based tests are unchanged). Added `isSessionAudience` guard +
`surfaceHeader` to `packages/shared/src/auth.ts`; new `sessionAudienceFromHeader()` +
`sessionAudienceForRequest()` = header ?? Origin-fallback in `cookies.ts`; the
Socket.IO ops-room handshake (`realtime.ts`) also prefers the header. The ops app
sends `operations` on every authenticated REST call (`api.ts`) and as socket
`extraHeaders` (`useOpsSocket.ts`). The **customer app was deliberately NOT changed**
— it already resolves to the `customer` cookie via the least-privileged default, and
adding a custom header to its GETs would reintroduce the CORS preflights its design
note avoids; session isolation (the v0.3.0 fix) stays covered by the existing
Origin-based tests and remains green. **Security:** the surface header only selects
WHICH cookie is read — it cannot grant access (RBAC `requireRole` checks unchanged),
so trusting the client's self-declared surface is safe.

**Discipline kept:** no money-path, schema, migration, ledger, money-contract, or auth
*model* change — only surface-resolution. Money discipline, the public site, the
customer dashboard, and onboarding untouched; balances stay derived; disclaimer
visible in both apps + README; no secrets.

**Surprises / environment friction (sandbox only):** same Prisma engine-download block
as Sessions 1–7 (ECONNRESET to `binaries.prisma.sh`); resolved the documented way
(`npm install --ignore-scripts` + curl-mirror the query-engine library + schema-engine
for `debian-openssl-3.0.x` + `PRISMA_*` env vars). Prisma 5.22.0, engine
`605197351a3c8bdd595af2d2a9bc3025bca48ea2`. Playwright used the pre-installed Chromium
via `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_PATH`. The real-browser WebServer logs showed `OPTIONS`
preflights returning **204** for the new `x-meridian-surface` header on `/api/ops/*`
GETs — `@fastify/cors` reflects requested headers by default, so **no CORS config
change was needed**. None of this affects normal machines or CI.

**Outcome:** `npm run verify` passes; **201** unit/integration tests (was 189; +12 —
`routes/ops-session-origin.test.ts` ×5 incl. the two header tests that FAILED against
the pre-fix backend, + `auth/cookies.test.ts` ×7) + **33** Playwright e2e in real
Chromium (was 32; +1 — the same-origin Origin-less-GET reproduction with a
self-validating `sawOriginlessOpsGet` guard; the v0.3.0 session-isolation bleed test
and the v0.6.1 B-03/B-04 e2e still green). No schema change this patch. Version bumped
to 0.6.2; annotated tag `v0.6.2` created locally (tag push blocked by env policy — HTTP
403 — so the human pushes it on merge; see the milestone report). Stopped at the patch
gate; did **not** start v0.7.0.

---

## Session 7 — v0.6.1 Operations console fixes (patch) — 2026-06-26

**Goal:** The human's v0.6.0 review reported two Meridian Operations bugs and
**explicitly re-scoped the session away from v0.7.0** to a patch release `v0.6.1`
fixing only those bugs (with v0.6.1-named docs) for them to test. So: do NOT start
Money movement; fix the two bugs, prove them, document, tag.

**Bug 1 (B-03) — nav disappears on a narrow window:** confirmed real. The ops
console sidebar was `lg:block`-only and hidden below `lg` with **no** replacement
control, so sections were unreachable on a narrow window. Fixed with an accessible
top-bar menu (☰) that opens the same links (factored into a shared `NavList` used by
both the desktop sidebar and the mobile panel), auto-closing on navigation.

**Bug 2 (B-04) — "Not authenticated" in Request queues; can't approve:** the
interesting one. The v0.6.0 e2e (which loads the queue as an operator) had passed
30/30, so the bug had to be environment/session-state-sensitive. Diagnosis by
reproduction, escalating fidelity:
- **Backend over HTTP (curl cookie jar, ops origin):** login sets `mer_ops_session`;
  `/api/auth/me` 200; `/api/ops/requests` 200 with the full queue. Backend correct.
- **Full onboarding loop over HTTP:** submit → operator approve → provisioned
  user/account → new customer signs in to the funded account. Approval path correct.
- **Real Chromium, clean profile:** queue renders all cards; every `/api/ops/*`
  call carries the cookie and returns 200. No bug in a clean session.
- **Real Chromium, invalid session mid-use** (cleared cookie / deleted session):
  the console kept rendering the authenticated shell while data calls 401'd —
  **reproducing the user's dead-end "Not authenticated".**

**Root cause (B-04):** the ops console decided it was signed in purely from
optimistic in-memory React state (the login response / the mount-time `fetchMe`) and
**never reconciled a subsequent API 401**. So any invalid/expired/stale operator
session (easy to hit across versions + backend restarts, or after the 8-hour TTL)
left the operator stranded — the queue page showed the raw "Not authenticated"; the
dashboard just looked empty; there was no path back. **The backend/cookie/auth code
was unchanged since v0.5.0 and is correct** — this was a client-side resilience gap.

**Fix (B-04):** the API client now recognises 401 `unauthenticated`/`session_expired`
(and ONLY those — a failed login's `invalid_credentials` is excluded) and invokes a
registered handler; `AuthContext` clears the user + sets `sessionEnded`, so the
existing gate shows the sign-in screen (tearing down the data provider + socket); the
login screen shows a clear "your session has ended" notice; a fresh sign-in recovers
the queue. Verified deterministically in real Chromium via Playwright route
interception forcing `/api/ops/**` → 401 (bounce + notice + recovery), plus a
clean-session regression (queue still loads).

**Discipline kept:** changes confined to the operations app + the shared version
string. No backend / schema / migration / ledger / contract / auth change; money
discipline, the public site, the customer dashboard, and onboarding untouched.

**Surprises / environment friction (sandbox only):** same Prisma engine-download
block as Sessions 1–6 (ECONNRESET to `binaries.prisma.sh`); resolved the documented
way (`npm install --ignore-scripts` + curl-mirror the query-engine library +
schema-engine for `debian-openssl-3.0.x` + `PRISMA_*` env vars). Prisma 5.22.0,
engine `605197351a3c8bdd595af2d2a9bc3025bca48ea2`. Playwright used the pre-installed
Chromium via `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_PATH`. None of this affects normal machines or CI.
Also hit a transient false failure while iterating: Vite HMR left a stale module so a
mid-edit Playwright check failed; a clean dev-server restart confirmed the fix — a
test-harness artifact, not a product issue.

**Outcome:** `npm run verify` passes; **189** unit/integration tests (unchanged) +
**32** Playwright e2e (was 30; +2 for the fixes) green. No schema change this patch.
Version bumped to 0.6.1; annotated tag `v0.6.1` created locally (tag push blocked by
env policy — HTTP 403 — so the human pushes it on merge; see the milestone report).
Stopped at the patch gate; did **not** start v0.7.0.

## Session 6 — v0.6.0 Onboarding and account opening — 2026-06-26

**Goal:** Complete only `v0.6.0 — Onboarding and account opening` (a real,
simulated open-account flow feeding the v0.5.0 ops queue; operator approval that
provisions a user + account + initial funding; joint-account invitations;
admin-created demo users), **and** address the v0.5.0 review: two ops-console
fixes (B-01 detail-panel buttons not deactivating; B-02 add a note after the
decision) plus two written answers (Q-01 deposit "Pending"; Q-02 what Simulated
Messaging is for). Human approved ("Everything else looks great.").

**Headline decision — this is where an operator approval first CREATES money, so
it had to stay inside the ledger discipline.** v0.5.0 kept operator actions
workflow-only; v0.6.0 introduces the first approval-with-a-ledger-effect, but only
the narrow safe case: approving an `onboarding` request provisions a `User` +
`Account` and posts any opening deposit as an explicit **bank-originated, posted
`deposit`** ledger entry — atomically (in a transaction), audited, and
precondition-guarded (blocked + rolled back if the email already exists). A test
asserts the system-wide settled total moves by **exactly** the funded amount and
by nothing else; balances stay derived. Admin-funded users use an audited
`adjustment` requiring a reason. Submitting an application / adding a note / a
joint invite move no money.

**Reuse over reinvention (per the constitution + the review):** the open-account
submission creates an `OperationsRequest` of type `onboarding` on the SAME queue,
flows through the SAME `applyOperatorAction` service, the SAME action route, and
the SAME Socket.IO `OpsRealtime` channel — no new ops endpoint, no new socket
event. The `note` action (B-02) is likewise the same action service/route/audit/
real-time, just non-decision (no status change, allowed on terminal). Joint-invite
acceptance creates a `joint` `AccountAccess` grant — the same grant RBAC already
reads. Onboarding identity/MFA and the invite "email" are `SimulatedEvent`s — the
existing simulated-messaging seam (the answer to Q-02), now driven by a real flow.

**Execution mode (serialized risky areas = contract, schema/migration, ledger,
routing, real-time):**
- `N-01` shared contract first: `@simbank/shared/onboarding` (DTOs + the PURE
  validators reused by client and server) + the `note` action added to
  `operations.ts` (without adding a fifth decision button) — unit-tested to LOCK
  the contract before anything built on it.
- `N-02` Prisma schema + the **second additive migration since v0.2.0**
  (`onboarding`: `OnboardingApplication` 1:1 with its request + holds the bcrypt
  hash server-side, never in a DTO; `AccountInvitation`) — verified additive (only
  `CREATE TABLE` + indexes; money/auth tables untouched).
- `N-03` seed (an approvable onboarding application + a pending joint invite) with
  a new `assertSeedOnboardingIntegrity`; money + access + ops invariants still pass.
- `N-04…N-08` services + routes + the note action — backend integration tests
  green (provisioning + the money invariant + RBAC matrix + note-on-terminal)
  BEFORE any UI.
- Only then the two frontends (`N-09/N-10` customer open-account + invitations,
  `N-11` ops B-01/B-02 + onboarding context + admin page) were parallelized across
  the two app agents against the LOCKED contract.
- A read-only security review ran before the gate; e2e + full `verify` last.

**Answers I owed the human (also in HUMAN_REVIEW_v0.6.md):**
- **Q-01 (deposit "Pending"):** deferred to **v0.7.0** with a clear reason —
  flipping a pending deposit to posted changes the available balance, i.e. it is
  money movement; doing it now would ship a half-built deposit-posting path ahead
  of the milestone that designs holds/availability/reversals. Recorded as an
  explicit v0.7.0 acceptance note (ROADMAP + NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT).
- **Q-02 (Simulated Messaging):** it is the provider "seam" — a clearly-labelled
  fake event instead of a real SMS/email/MFA/identity provider; v0.6.0 onboarding
  is its first real use, and 2FA-at-login will use the same `SimulatedEvent` model
  when that auth sub-feature lands.

**Surprises / environment friction (sandbox only — not a product issue):** same
Prisma engine-download block as Sessions 1–5 (ECONNRESET to `binaries.prisma.sh`);
resolved the documented way — `npm install --ignore-scripts`, curl-mirror the
query-engine library + schema-engine for `debian-openssl-3.0.x`, point Prisma at
them via `PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_LIBRARY` + `PRISMA_SCHEMA_ENGINE_BINARY`
(+ `PRISMA_ENGINES_CHECKSUM_IGNORE_MISSING`). Prisma 5.22.0, engine
`605197351a3c8bdd595af2d2a9bc3025bca48ea2`. Created the real `onboarding`
migration through the mirrored schema engine. Playwright used the pre-installed
Chromium via `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_PATH`. None of this affects normal machines or CI.

**Outcome:** `npm run verify` passes; **189** unit/integration (was 145) +
**30** Playwright e2e (was 25) green. Second additive migration
(`onboarding`); no new runtime audit advisories; security review PASS. Milestone
complete; annotated tag `v0.6.0` created locally (tag push blocked by env policy —
HTTP 403 — so the human pushes it on merge; see the milestone report). Session
branch pushed. Stopped at the gate; did **not** start v0.7.0.

---

## Session 5 — v0.5.0 Operations simulator core — 2026-06-25

**Goal:** Complete only `v0.5.0 — Operations simulator core` (live request queues,
operator approve/reject/hold/request-info actions each audited, real-time updates
over Socket.IO, simulated SMS/email/MFA/identity events). Human approved with
"Everything looks good so far. Keep moving forward toward the next milestone." —
saved verbatim, interpreted as approval to proceed (no re-scope).

**Key decision — preserve money discipline by making actions workflow-only.** The
biggest scoping call: an operator action in v0.5.0 changes a request's **status**
and writes an audit row, but never posts to the ledger. Approving a "deposit" or
"ACH" request does not move money — the ledger effects of an approval belong to
money movement (v0.7.0). A test (`ops.test.ts` "operator actions never create
ledger entries") enforces this, so the disciplined-ledger rule is kept by
construction, not just intention. This also kept the milestone tightly scoped.

**Execution mode (serialized risky areas = contract, schema/migration, routing,
real-time + socket RBAC):**
- `O-01` shared `operations.ts` contract (action state machine + DTOs + socket
  payloads) written and unit-tested **first** to lock the contract before anything
  built on it.
- `O-02` Prisma schema flesh-out + the **first migration since v0.2.0**
  (`operations_core`, additive — money/auth tables untouched), verified by reading
  the generated SQL.
- `O-03` seed (10-item dated queue + 4 simulated events + intake audit rows) with
  new `assertSeedOpsIntegrity`; money + access invariants still pass.
- `O-04` ops service (state machine + audit reuse + mappers) → `O-05` testable
  `OpsRealtime` publisher + Socket.IO handshake RBAC (operators room) → `O-06`
  RBAC-gated routes. Backend tests green, then a **live socket check** proved the
  operator socket receives events while a customer socket does not.
- Only then `O-07`/`O-08` the console (one `OpsDataProvider` = one socket + live
  state), built against the locked contract.
- `O-10` read-only security review ran before the gate.

**Key decisions:**
- **Socket RBAC by room, decided at the handshake.** Both apps share one Socket.IO
  server, so ops events go to an `ops` room joined only by a valid `ops_agent`/
  `admin` *operations* session (cookie resolved from the request Origin, reusing
  the v0.3.0 per-surface cookie logic). Default-deny: customer/anonymous sockets
  connect for welcome/heartbeat but never join the room.
- **Testable real-time.** Routes emit through an injected `OpsRealtime` publisher
  (no-op default / Socket.IO impl / recording double), so route tests assert
  emissions via `app.inject` with no socket, and a separate integration test
  exercises the real handshake/join path.
- **One live data context on the client** owns a single socket + the in-memory
  queue/feed; actions update optimistically and the socket echoes idempotently (by
  id) and delivers other operators' changes.
- **Reuse AuditLog + requireRole** rather than inventing new mechanisms — the audit
  trail and RBAC primitives already existed.

**Security review:** PASS (no Critical/High). Its one **Medium** — the socket-room
RBAC, the most security-critical new code, had no automated test — was **closed in
this milestone**: added `apps/backend/src/realtime.test.ts`, which boots
`attachRealtime` on an ephemeral port and uses real `socket.io-client` connections
to assert an operator joins + receives while customer/anonymous do not (all still
get `welcome`). Two Lows: the detail route's 403 added to the RBAC test loop; a
future `subjectName` cap tracked for v0.6.0 onboarding.

**Surprises / environment friction (sandbox only — not a product issue):**
- Same Prisma engine-download block as Sessions 1–4 (ECONNRESET to
  `binaries.prisma.sh`). Resolved the documented way — `npm install
  --ignore-scripts`, curl-mirror the query-engine library + schema-engine for
  `debian-openssl-3.0.x`, point Prisma at them via `PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_LIBRARY` +
  `PRISMA_SCHEMA_ENGINE_BINARY` (+ `PRISMA_ENGINES_CHECKSUM_IGNORE_MISSING`). Prisma
  5.22.0, engine `605197351a3c8bdd595af2d2a9bc3025bca48ea2`. This session also
  created a real **migration** through the mirrored schema engine (not just `db
  push`), which worked fine.
- Same Playwright/Chromium build mismatch — used the pre-installed Chromium
  (`/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome`) via `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_PATH`.

**Outcome:** `npm run verify` passes; **145** unit/integration (was 93) + **25**
Playwright e2e (was 22) green. Additive `operations_core` migration; no new runtime
audit advisories; security review PASS (its Medium closed in-milestone). Milestone
complete; annotated tag `v0.5.0` created locally (tag push blocked by env policy —
HTTP 403 — so the human pushes it on merge; see the milestone report). Session
branch pushed. Stopped at the gate; did **not** start v0.6.0.

## Session 4 — v0.4.0 Customer banking dashboard — 2026-06-25

**Goal:** Complete only `v0.4.0 — Customer banking dashboard` (accounts overview,
account detail, transaction history with pending vs posted + search/filter,
statements placeholder, realistic seeded transactions — balances DERIVED), **and**
address the v0.3.0 review feedback: two public-site UX fixes (R-01 scroll-to-top +
a Security deep-link; R-02 session-aware entry points). Human approved starting
v0.4.0.

**Key realization — no schema migration needed.** A "transaction" is already a row
of the append-only `LedgerEntry` table (it carries `status` pending/posted/held/…,
`origin`, amount+direction, description, postedAt/createdAt). So v0.4.0 avoided the
riskiest shared area (Prisma schema) entirely: the work was a pure shared contract +
derivation, a richer **seed** (with per-entry dating), one **access-scoped read
endpoint**, and the **dashboard UI**. This was the single biggest scoping decision.

**Execution mode (serialized risky area = the API contract + the data every screen
reads):**
- R-01/R-02 (R-01 touches routing) done **first**, e2e-tested.
- Then `D-01` shared DTOs + pure derivation (`toTransactionDTOs`,
  `filterTransactions`) written and unit-tested to **lock the contract**.
- Then `D-02` seed + `D-03` access-scoped endpoint with integration tests.
- Only then the dashboard UI (`D-04…D-07`) built against the locked contract.
- A read-only security review ran before the gate (**PASS**, no new findings).

**Key decisions:**
- **Reuse the v0.2.0 access primitive** (`getAccountRelationship`) for
  `GET /api/accounts/:id/transactions` so the transactions endpoint inherits the
  exact ownership/joint scoping (and IDOR-safety) of the single-account read — no
  parallel access path to get wrong.
- **One filtering definition** (`filterTransactions` in shared) used by BOTH the
  server endpoint (`?q=&group=&origin=`, whitelisted) and the UI (instant
  client-side filter over the fetched rows) — same behavior, tested once.
- **Running balance derived server-side** in chronological order over settled
  entries, then attached to the newest-first list, so the statement reads correctly
  while the API returns rows newest-first.
- **Seed built via paired helpers** (`transfer()` posts both legs; `daysAgo` dates
  each entry) so the money invariants (transfers net to zero; every settled credit
  bank-originated or a transfer leg) stay trivially satisfied even at 56 entries.
- **R-01 as one router-level effect** (`ScrollToTop`) rather than wiring each
  button — it keys off the location, so every control (header/footer/in-page CTA)
  is covered; a `#hash` destination scrolls the section in (with `scroll-mt` under
  the sticky header) instead of jumping to the top.
- **R-02 via a pure `resolveCtas` helper** that rewrites only `/login` + 
  `/open-account` CTAs to a single deduped "Visit your Dashboard" when signed in;
  the `/login` route gains an "already signed in" branch. No client-side trust for
  protection — `RequireAuth` + server `requireAuth` are unchanged.

**Surprises / environment friction (sandbox only — not a product issue):**
- Same Prisma engine-download block as Sessions 1–3 (ECONNRESET to
  `binaries.prisma.sh` from Prisma's fetcher; curl reaches it). Resolved the same
  documented way — `npm install --ignore-scripts`, curl-mirror the query-engine
  library + schema-engine for `debian-openssl-3.0.x` (gz names
  `libquery_engine.so.node.gz` / `schema-engine.gz`), point Prisma at them via
  `PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_LIBRARY` + `PRISMA_SCHEMA_ENGINE_BINARY`
  (+ `PRISMA_ENGINES_CHECKSUM_IGNORE_MISSING`). Prisma 5.22.0, engine
  `605197351a3c8bdd595af2d2a9bc3025bca48ea2`.
- Same Playwright/Chromium build mismatch — used the pre-installed Chromium
  (`/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome`) via `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_PATH`.
- No new product surprises; the seed dating + running-balance derivation were
  validated end-to-end against the live DB before building the UI.

**Outcome:** `npm run verify` passes; **93** unit/integration (was 70) + **22**
Playwright e2e (was 14) green. No schema change; no new runtime audit advisories;
security review PASS. Milestone complete; annotated tag `v0.4.0` created locally
(tag push blocked by env policy — HTTP 403 — so the human pushes it on merge; see
the milestone report). Session branch pushed. Stopped at the gate; did **not**
begin v0.5.0.

**Carried forward / open items:** statements are a placeholder until v0.9.0;
money-movement (which creates *new* transactions) is v0.7.0 — today's history is
seeded; frontend component unit tests still deferred; security hardening
follow-ups (CSRF, config-driven cookie `secure`, helmet + rate-limit) and
dev-tooling audit advisories still tracked in `QUALITY_REPORT.md`.

## Session 3 — v0.3.0 Public bank website and branding — 2026-06-25

**Goal:** Complete only `v0.3.0 — Public bank website and branding` (polished home
page, product marketing pages, image placeholders + prompts, login/open-account
entry points, responsive + accessible polish), **and** address the v0.2.0 review
feedback: a cross-app session-bleed bug. Human approved starting v0.3.0.

**Execution mode:**
- The **bug fix (W-00)** touches auth + routing — a **risky shared area** — so it
  was done **first and serially**, locked behind the full test suite, then
  re-verified at the browser level before any website work.
- The **public-site work** is single-app (`apps/customer`) and was built on a
  shared marketing-component contract for brand consistency.

**The reported bug had TWO root causes (both fixed):**
1. **Shared host-only cookie.** Both apps hit the same backend origin; the session
   cookie had no `Domain`, so it was a host-only `localhost` cookie shared across
   ports — one session for both apps. Fixed with **per-surface cookies**
   (`mer_session` / `mer_ops_session`) selected by request `Origin` (also matched
   by the ops port for LAN hosts).
2. **Logout returned 400 and never revoked.** The customer logout sent a `POST`
   with `Content-Type: application/json` and **no body**; Fastify rejects an empty
   JSON body with 400, so the handler never ran — session not revoked, cookie not
   cleared. The client cleared its own state best-effort, which **masked** it (no
   v0.2.0 test navigated to a protected route after logout). Fixed by not declaring
   a JSON content-type on bodyless requests, plus a backend empty-JSON-body
   tolerance. Found by writing a browser-level e2e that reproduced the exact
   two-tab scenario — a good argument for testing the *server-side* effect of
   logout, not just the client UI state.

**Key decisions:**
- **Per-surface cookies keyed by Origin** instead of a schema/audience column — the
  smallest correct fix, no migration, minimal blast radius.
- **Reusable `components/marketing.tsx` kit** + `lib/nav.ts` (nav split out so the
  presentational module stays component-only and react-refresh-clean).
- **Coming-soon pages** for Cards and Loans/CDs now (clearly tagged) so the nav and
  product story are complete ahead of v0.8.0/v0.9.0.
- **Accessibility baked in**: skip link, landmarks, labelled mobile-menu toggle,
  alt text on every image slot; disclaimer visible site-wide.

**Surprises / environment friction (sandbox only — not a product issue):**
- Same Prisma engine-download block as Sessions 1–2 (ECONNRESET to
  `binaries.prisma.sh` from Prisma's own fetcher, though curl reaches it). Resolved
  by `npm install --ignore-scripts` then **curl-mirroring** the query-engine
  library + schema-engine for `debian-openssl-3.0.x` (note: the remote gz names are
  `libquery_engine.so.node.gz` / `schema-engine.gz`) and pointing Prisma at them via
  `PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_LIBRARY` + `PRISMA_SCHEMA_ENGINE_BINARY` (+
  `PRISMA_ENGINES_CHECKSUM_IGNORE_MISSING`). Prisma is now **5.22.0** (engine
  `605197351a3c8bdd595af2d2a9bc3025bca48ea2`).
- Same Playwright/Chromium build mismatch — used the pre-installed Chromium
  (`/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome`) via the existing
  `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_PATH` hook (executablePath bypasses the build-version check).
- The first cut of the browser-level isolation e2e raced (clicked Log out then
  navigated immediately, aborting the in-flight logout). Fixed by waiting for the
  logged-out header before navigating — but that wait is *also* what surfaced the
  real logout-400 bug above.

**Outcome:** `npm run verify` passes; **70** unit/integration + **14** Playwright
e2e green (up from 65 + 8). No schema change. Milestone complete; annotated tag
`v0.3.0` created locally (tag push blocked by env policy — HTTP 403 — so the human
pushes it on merge; see the milestone report). Session branch pushed. Stopped at
the gate; did **not** begin v0.4.0.

**Carried forward / open items:** marketing images are placeholders until real
files are dropped in; `/open-account` is a placeholder pending v0.6.0 onboarding;
security follow-ups (CSRF, config-driven cookie `secure`, helmet + rate-limit) and
dev-tooling audit advisories still tracked in `QUALITY_REPORT.md`.

## Session 2 — v0.2.0 Auth, roles, and demo users — 2026-06-25

**Goal:** Complete only `v0.2.0 — Auth, roles, and demo users`: real password
hashing, cookie sessions + lockout, seeded demo users per role, role-based
access control (ownership), login history/audit, and initial Playwright login
tests. Human feedback was an explicit approval to start v0.2.0 with no re-scope.

**Execution mode:** Controlled multi-agent, as the project rules intend.
- The **backend auth core is a risky shared area** (schema, auth, routing), so it
  was implemented **serially** by the orchestrator: shared auth contracts →
  Prisma schema + migration → password/token/lockout/session/access/guard
  modules → routes → seed → backend tests. Locked and verified green first.
- The **two frontend apps are independent**, so once the API contract was locked
  they were built **in parallel** by the Frontend Customer and Frontend
  Operations subagents against a precise written contract, then reviewed.
- A read-only **Security/Permissions** subagent audited the result before the
  gate; the **Testing/QA** work (Playwright login journeys) and **Process Scribe**
  handoff docs closed it out.

**Key decisions:**
- **bcryptjs** (pure-JS) for hashing rather than native bcrypt/argon2 — a real,
  standard library that needs no native toolchain, matching the project's
  cross-platform, zero-friction ethos. Argon2 noted as a future hardening option.
- **Opaque cookie sessions**: a random token in an httpOnly `SameSite=Lax`
  cookie; the DB stores only its **SHA-256 hash**, with a sliding idle timeout.
  Standard-library crypto only — no custom cryptography.
- **`AccountAccess` table as the RBAC backbone**: every owner gets an `owner`
  grant and joint users get scoped grants, so "who can see what" has one source
  of truth and the ownership tests rest on real data (Jordan ⊂ Avery's checking
  only).
- **Two trails**: `LoginEvent` (every attempt → login history + lockout source)
  and `AuditLog` (notable events: login, logout, lockout), mirroring how admin
  actions are audited elsewhere.
- **Login defenses**: lockout after 5 failures (15-min window, fresh after
  expiry) and a decoy-hash comparison so unknown-email and wrong-password
  responses are indistinguishable (no user enumeration).
- **Isolated test DB**: backend integration tests run in a single fork against a
  dedicated `prisma db push` SQLite file, so they never touch the dev DB and
  never race on the shared file.

**Surprises / environment friction (sandbox only — not a product issue):**
- Same Prisma engine-download block as Session 1 (ECONNRESET to
  `binaries.prisma.sh`). Resolved the same way — curl-mirror the engine binaries
  and point Prisma at them via the `PRISMA_*` env vars. Normal machines / CI
  download engines normally.
- Same Playwright/Chromium build mismatch (pre-installed 1194 vs Playwright
  1.61's expected build). Used the existing opt-in `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_PATH`
  hook pointing at the pre-installed Chromium.
- Vitest `fileParallelism: false` alone did **not** serialize the two DB-touching
  integration files in the workspace; they raced on the shared SQLite file
  (unique-constraint error). Fixed by also forcing the backend project into a
  single fork (`poolOptions.forks.singleFork`).
- Two initial Playwright selectors were too loose (strict-mode "resolved to 2
  elements" — a duplicate "Log in" CTA on the home page and the operator name in
  both header and intro). Scoped them to the header `banner` role.

**Outcome:** `npm run verify` passes; **65** unit/integration + **8** Playwright
e2e tests green (up from 20 + 3). Milestone complete; annotated tag `v0.2.0`
created locally (tag push blocked by the environment's git policy — HTTP 403 —
so the human pushes it on merge; see the milestone report). Session branch
pushed. Stopped at the gate; did **not** begin v0.3.0.

**Carried forward / open items:** MFA / password-reset / device-trust deferred
within the auth theme to later milestones; CSRF noted as a future hardening item
(mitigated for now by `SameSite=Lax` + a CORS allowlist); dev-tooling audit
advisories and deferred frontend component tests still tracked in
`QUALITY_REPORT.md`.

## Session 1 — v0.1.0 Project Foundation — 2026-06-25

**Goal:** Initialize the repo and complete only `v0.1.0 — Project Foundation`:
durable foundation, docs/process framework, local dev setup, and CI.

**Execution mode:** Emulated-sequential. The controlled multi-agent roles
(Planner, Backend, Frontend ×2, Testing/QA, Security, Process Scribe) are defined
in `.claude/agents/`, but v0.1.0 is almost entirely *risky shared area* work
(schema, routing, architecture, CI, repo structure) which the project rules say
to **serialize**. So a single session performed the plan → implement → test →
review → scribe steps in sequence and authored the agent definitions for future
parallelizable milestones.

**What was built:** see `CHANGELOG.md` [0.1.0] and `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`.
Monorepo, shared money/ledger library, Fastify+Socket.IO+Prisma backend, two
React+Vite apps, branding, tests, CI, and the full docs/process framework.

**Key decisions (see ADR-0001):**
- Stack pinned to stable, mainstream versions for future-session ergonomics.
- **Disciplined ledger from day one** — derived balances, integer minor units,
  conservation tests — even though no real transactions exist yet, so the
  discipline is structural rather than retrofitted.
- **Fastify 5** (not 4): the audit flagged the Fastify-4 → `fast-uri` chain;
  Fastify 5.8.5 is patched, so the backend runtime has **0 audit
  vulnerabilities**. APIs used are v5-compatible.
- **No committed `.env`:** a small `prisma-cli.mjs` wrapper provides the local
  SQLite URL cross-platform; Prisma resolves relative `file:` paths against the
  schema dir for both CLI and client, so `file:./dev.db` is unambiguous.

**Surprises / environment friction (sandbox only — not a product issue):**
- Prisma's engine downloader could not reach `binaries.prisma.sh` through the
  Claude Code Cloud egress proxy (ECONNRESET). Resolved by hosting a **local
  mirror** of the engine binaries (curl works through the proxy) and pointing
  Prisma at it via `PRISMA_ENGINES_MIRROR` + `PRISMA_ENGINES_CHECKSUM_IGNORE_MISSING`.
  Normal machines and GitHub Actions download engines normally — no project
  change needed.
- The pre-installed Chromium (1194) didn't match Playwright 1.61's expected
  build (1228). Added an **opt-in** `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_PATH` config hook (no-op
  for normal users/CI) and pointed it at the pre-installed browser.
- Initial seed invariant was too strict (treated a legitimate external
  *payment* outflow as "missing money"). Reframed to the correct invariants:
  transfers net to zero, and every settled credit is bank-originated or a
  transfer leg.

**Outcome:** `npm run verify` passes; 20 unit/integration + 3 smoke tests green;
runtime audit clean. Milestone complete; annotated tag `v0.1.0` created locally
(tag push is blocked by the environment's git policy — HTTP 403 — so the human
pushes it on merge to `main`; see the milestone report for commands). The
session branch was pushed. Stopped at the gate; did **not** begin v0.2.0.

**Carried forward / open items:** dev-tooling audit advisories (vite, vitest,
esbuild); deferred frontend component tests. Tracked in `QUALITY_REPORT.md`.

## Blocker-handling policy (applies every session)

If a required task genuinely fails after real attempts: try to fix it; if still
blocked, write a file under `docs/process/blockers/` containing what failed, what
was attempted, remaining errors, likely cause, options (retry / simplify / defer
/ remove / replace), a recommendation, and an exact suggested prompt for the next
session. Then **do not** mark the milestone complete or tag it; stop with a
truthful blocker report. Prioritize truthful project state over appearing done.

_No blockers were filed for v0.1.0, v0.2.0, v0.3.0, or v0.4.0._
